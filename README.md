## Background and Motivation

PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) Mobile is a game that just recently made me start to like video games again after six long years of me not playing any. It is an online multiplayer game developed and published by PUBG Corporation. Although I only played the mobile version of it, I love to watch different PUBG eSport tournaments and cheer for my favorite teams. In the middle of May of 2020, PUBG had an online regional tournament structure call the PUBG Continental Series (PCS) Charity Showdown. It is a series of global events wherein each region, teams will compete for $200,000 with $100,000 of that pot being donated to a charity of the winning teamâ€™s choosing. To me, this is a very exciting tournament for two reasons. First, my favorite team (Division X Gaming) is one of the teams from Vietnam to enter the final stage, compete with different teams in the APAC region and won! The last reason is that it is a huge deal for any winning team to be able to bring that winning cash prize back to their countries to support the community during this crazy pandemic time.

Usually, in a team-based game, there are specific roles for each member of the team. Each role is associated with different responsibilities but ultimately they help to lead the team to its final goal. That is not so clear for this tournament because only some teams stated their players' roles. For this project, I will analyze all players' statistics in the final stage of the PUBG PCS Charity Showdown tournament to see if I can use machine learning to group players with similar characteristics together to form different groups. This will help me to identify different roles among all players and to see if there is any trend that associates with the overall team placements. To do so, I need to learn about a different type of machine learning compare to what I have used. This time, I will need to learn about clustering in unsupervised machine learning to segregate data based on the similarity between data instances. Here are some of the objectives I look forward to achieve for this project:

1. Scrape table data from a website using `selenium`
2. Improve my EDA skills
3. Build a `K-means` clustering model to group players together

This will be a very fun project for me to do and will also be a very useful model to provide insightful information for PUBG eSport teams analysts to see what type of players they have and what they need in order to be the best team. Here are some of the questions that this project can answer:

1. How many types of players are there in the PCS Charity Showdown tournament?
2. What are the players' roles that high placement teams have in common? 

## Prerequisites

Python Version: 3.7.4

Packages: selenium, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, kneed, statsmodels.

## Project Outline

1. Data Collection: I used `selenium` to scrape a table data from "[https://sea.pubgrank.org/pcs-charity-showdown#information](https://sea.pubgrank.org/pcs-charity-showdown#information)". This website is very useful because it has all sort of statistics related to the teams and players in the tournament's final stage. I scaped three different tables: result, player stats, and kill/phase.
2. Data Cleaning: I unified all the teams names to their abbreviation; remove the unit word (s, m, etc) for all values.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
4. Model Building:

### [Data Collection](https://github.com/chilam27/PUBG_Tournament_Analysis/blob/master/P05_DataCollection.py)

I created this web scraper for table data through `selenium` to get the data from three different tables. Then, I exported these data into three CSV files. The general description of each data frames and their columns are listed below:

* Result (16,43): has the general information of all the 16 teams and their points (kill and placement points) for all 20 rounds (the entire final stage has 20 rounds).
* Player stats (66,12): contains more specific statistics of each of the 66 players; the 12 columns in the table are:
  * player_rank = their overall rank
  * player = player's name
  * match = match participated
  * damages = total damage
  * knock = total knock count
  * kill = total kill count
  * survive = the average survival time
  * assist = total assist count
  * longest = longest kill distance (m)
  * traveled = total travel distance (km)
  * accuracy = player's firing accuracy
  * main_weapon = main weapon that was used
* Kill/Phase (16,11): has the kill count of the 20 rounds from each team in 9 different phases (each round has 9 phases).

### [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/chilam27/PUBG_Tournament_Analysis/blob/master/P05.DataCleaning.py)

* Cleaned up text in teams name and change it to its abbreviation form
* Return the current "survive" column time format (xx m xx s)to second
* Remove the unit word (s, m, etc) for all values.
* Return the percentage value in "accuracy" column to its decimal form
* Created two new columns: "kill_per_match" (player's average kill count per match) and "damages_per_match" (player's average damage per match)
* Created a team placement for each player in the player data frame
* Reformat the values in kill data frame 

### [EDA](https://github.com/chilam27/PUBG_Tournament_Analysis/blob/master/P05_EDA.ipynb)

* Take a look at the dimensions of the three tables and their first five rows. The two data frames that I will focus on the most are "df_player" (player stats) and "df_kill" (kill/phase).

* The first variable I examine is the "kill" count. The distribution below seems to follow a bimodal distribution with the two modes are around 15 and 20. It does have one outlier with a value of around 39. Interestingly, the distribution is bimodal instead of (approximately) normal distribution. Maybe the median can act as a clear separation between the higher kills group and the lower kills group.

* Because the kill count is the main determination of the rank of the player. I want to see what kind of relationship does "kill" has with the overall "team_placement" by plotting a group of box plot below. In this figure, although not so clear, there is a trend that the higher the team ranking is, the higher the kill count range is. I am the most surprised by the 1st ranking team because it seems like, the team kills counts is quite low except for one outstanding player in the team with the highest kill out of all players in the tournament.

</p>

* Next, I compare the players' damage, knock, kill, and assist statistics. To do so, I need to unify all units of the variables (for damage, I divide the value by 100 because player health is out of 100). Interestingly, the trends for damage, knock, and assist are very similar while the kill count's trend is very smooth. It is expected that, on the player's average, the kill count would be higher than the knock count but lower than the damage dealt because players tend to steal kill (one player knock a player but the other finished him) of each other.

* For the number of matches, players compete in, I plot a histogram count plot to see how many substitute players are there. In the later part, I will do some comparative analysis between the group of main and substitute players.

</p>

* Similar to the kill count's trend, though not so clear and quite weak, the survival times of players increases as the player's rank (and kill) increases. It then can be said that the player that kills more has a higher chance of surviving longer in a match. We can especially see the trend very clearly when I group players that are in the same team for each box plot in figure 6. For the first ranking team, compensate for their average kill counts, it seems like the team got the most point from surviving into the later rounds.

* I plotted the two variables' accuracy and longest to see if they have any relationship. I assumed that the higher the player that has longer kill range is more likely to have higher accuracy compare to others. But the figure below shows that it is not true.
